# bifurcationDetection_deep_learning

This is essentially running inference of the models trained in these papers: 

- [Miry R.](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.07764v1#S2)
- [Chakraborty A.](https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~hwang/rsif-2024-0199.pdf)

on CDC provided FLU hospitilzation dataset. All code can be found in the Colab Notebook.
